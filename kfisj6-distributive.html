I'm working through Spivak's Calculus and I'm trying to understand this "basic property of numbers." In the book, the distributive law is defined as a(b + c) = ab + ac. I know from earlier math classes that it should apply to any polynomial, not just to binomials—e.g. a(b + c + d) = ab +ac + ad. But for the purpose of writing proofs, I'm afraid to make that assumption unless I can prove it, or am given it. So, is it acceptable to assume that a number can be distributed across a polynomial Подробная карта городов России: поиск по адресу, телефоны, отзывы, фото, часы работы фирм и удобный поиск проезда. Hey guys! I'm really bad at math! I'm in a prerequisite course in college cause I'm not that good at it but they said I still have a chance of getting my grade up and now we are working on factoring polynomials and using FOIL I have some example questions I really need help on how to do. 11x(3x - 3) + 5(3x-3) This is confusing me. Do I use FOIL here? And how exactly do I got about solving this? Another example that has me stumped is 15f^13 - 9f^10 + 9f^9 - 15f^6 + 18f^5 than the answer. 
Commutative, Associative and Distributive Laws. Wow! What a mouthful of words! But the ideas are simple. Commutative Laws. The "Commutative Laws" say we can swap numbers over and still get the same answer. In English we have special words for a half, a third, and a quarter (the last optional.) Otherwise we use ordinal numbers with the indefinite rather than the definite article to form fractions: a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, etc. Although I am a native English speaker, I have never understood why this makes sense. Being mathematically challenged probably doesn't help. Though my language has existed for years now, I have yet to come up with an elegant, non-arbitrary way of forming fractions.
